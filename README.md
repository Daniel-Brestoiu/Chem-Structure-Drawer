# Chem Structure Drawer
The **chem structures drawer** was something I made to be able to quickly draw basic chemical structures on my laptop, and copy them into notes for my chemistry class. 
First, draw the structure on the initial, blue screen. 
After the structure is complete, click the button to enter selection mode. 
Select your structure, and click the save button. 
The save button will use Command + Control + Shift + 4 to save to clipboard.
Now you can easily paste the structure into wherever you please.


### Getting Started:
Simply copy and run the code on Chem Structures App.py
Ensure you also have Take_Screenshot.py to allow the save feature
Ensure you have everything in the requirements.txt file.
Since the save button uses keyboard commands, you may be notified for permissions.

### Deployment:
This script was developed for MacOS Catalina, and has not been tested on any other systems.
Thus, some or all features may be missing or non-functional.

### Background Info/Additional Notes:  
This was made to help me take chemistry notes, but due to the covid pandemic, I am no longer in chemistry class.
Thus, this project will henceforth be discontinued and it will be unlikely to receive updates.
This was my first project and I would be very happy if people find it helped them in any way.
Click the in-app help button for controls.

##### Built With:
Tkinter - GUI
pyautogui - Copy to Clipboard automation

##### Versioning:
